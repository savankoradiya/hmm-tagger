## Introduction

This notebook implements  to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a [universal tagset](http://www.petrovi.de/data/universal.pdf) using the [Pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate) library. Hidden Markov models are used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more.
